some methods to investigate Planck and radiance
The explanations are all in the comments
Planck implementaton is standard except it returns in meters.
Some versions use 2pi and 8pi I am not sure there is any need.
On integration the result is multiplied by PI, there is a reference.

I am not  physics person so units can be confusing and the entire area is
fraut with terminiology, the units are in SI.

Note: the plot is in a separate pdf, markdown for some reason refused point blank to include it, could not work out why!
